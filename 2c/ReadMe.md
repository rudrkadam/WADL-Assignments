To serve the app from the `dist` folder, you can use a simple web server. One popular option is to use the built-in Node.js HTTP server. Follow these steps:

1. Install the `http-server` package globally if you haven't already:
   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the `dist/your-app` folder and run:
   ```
   http-server
   ```
