To serve the app from the *dist* folder, you can use a simple web server. One popular option is to use the built-in Node.js HTTP server. Follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install -g http-server` to install the *http-server* package globally if you haven't.

2. Navigate to the *dist/your-app* folder and run `http-server`.
